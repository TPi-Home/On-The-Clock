WoW Addon to leave an LFG group if inactivity is detected. This was made ensure I don't get a ban if I am playing group content at work and have to AFK to help a customer.

## **WARNING:**
This is the first WoW addon I have made. I made this addon for me and my specific situation. IF there is community interest, I will further develop it so others can use it, but it is very much in an alpha state currently and could become problematic. I would hate to see someone use this addon and get teleported out in the middle of a raid because they trusted my work too much. Below is a relevant excerpt from the GNU General Public License used in this software:

For the protection of both the developer and the author, the GPL clearly states that there is no warranty for this free software. To protect both the user and the author, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as such, so that any issues are not erroneously attributed to the authors of previous versions.
